This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Partner Solution reference architecture on the AWS Cloud. http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Partner Solutions] are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to launch, configure, and run the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS. 

This Partner Solution is for system administrators and IT professionals who want to deploy
GitHub Enterprise on a virtual machine hosted in the AWS Cloud. Deploying GitHub
Enterprise on AWS provides a configurable infrastructure for your coding and deployment
tasks. Additional details about GitHub Enterprise are available at

GitHub Enterprise is a development and collaboration platform that enables developers to
build and share software easily and effectively. Development teams of all sizes, from small
startups to teams of thousands, use GitHub Enterprise to facilitate their software
development and deployment tasks. 

GitHub Enterprise provides the following features:

* *The GitHub Flow*: Developers can use the same asynchronous workflow created by
the open source community to collaborate on projects. This workflow encourages a
culture of experimentation without risk. For more information about the GitHub
Flow, see the GitHub Enterprise website.
* *Integrated platform*: At GitHub, we use GitHub Enterprise across the entire
development process, which enables us to release and deploy our code dozens of
times per day. This platform for continuous integration and deployment enables you
to build and ship better software faster.
* *Transparent collaboration*: Pull requests let developers interactively learn from
one another during the development process. Whether they’re discussing the whole
project or a single line of code, GitHub Enterprise displays the relevant information
in a clean, timeline-style interface.
* *Advanced monitoring*: You can use GitHub Pulse to see a snapshot of everything
that’s happened in your project repository during the past week, or visit the Activity
Dashboard to view graphs that illustrate work across projects. Advanced monitoring
can include Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), collectd, and log
forwarding on the appliance as well. For details, see the GitHub Enterprise
documentation.
* *Auditing and compliance*: Over time, your organization might have developed
crucial policies around permissions and security auditing. You can use the Commit

Status API in GitHub Enterprise to specify the unique merge conditions necessary
for your organization’s compliance requirements. GitHub Enterprise also provides
in-depth monitoring and auditing for administrators. For details, see the GitHub
Enterprise documentation.
* *Smarter version control*: GitHub Enterprise is built on Git, which is a distributed
version control system that supports non-linear workflows on projects of all sizes.
