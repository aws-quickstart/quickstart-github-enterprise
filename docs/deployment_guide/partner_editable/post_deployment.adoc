== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

The Partner Solution sets up a sample organization and repository during the deployment
process. You can test the deployment by accessing the GitHub Enterprise EC2 instance,
accessing the sample repository, and cloning it.

1. Use the URL of the primary instance displayed in the Outputs tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.
2. Log in to GitHub Enterprise. Enter the site administrator user name and password you provided in the Partner Solution parameters.

3. Upload a deploy key. This is an SSH key that gives you access to the sample GitHubrepository.

* Navigate to http://<githuburl>/setting/keys.
* In the sidebar, choose *SSH and GPG keys*.
* Choose *New SSH key*.
** For *Title*, give your key a descriptive name.
** In the *Key* field, paste your public key. This key is typically found in~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
** Choose *Add SSH key*
